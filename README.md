At **Angular Chile** we want to contribute to OSS in every way possible. That's why we start to build packages available to OSS community with many goals in mind:
* Promote the use of Angular as a framework of choice.
* Build tools for the community to simplify the workflow in personal and commercial projects.
* Promote the use of testing tools and related workflows by default.
* Use developed tools in workshops and live events of Angular Chile Community.
